## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create and run a lightweight web server using Nginx in a Docker container. It serves a static HTML page with a simple message.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: You can download and install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vikashchaurasiya07/Nginx-Web-server.git
   cd Nginx-Web-server
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image**:
   Create the Docker image from the `Dockerfile`:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-nginx .
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Docker container**:
   Start the container in detached mode, mapping port `8080` on your host to port `80` in the container:
   ```bash
   docker run --name my-nginx-container -d -p 8080:80 my-nginx
   ```

2. **Access the web server**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```
   You should see the message "Hello, Nginx!".

## How It Works

- **Dockerfile**: This project includes a `Dockerfile` that specifies the base image as the official Nginx image from Docker Hub.
- **HTML Content**: The static HTML file `index.html` is copied to the appropriate directory within the container where Nginx serves files.
- **Port Mapping**: The container maps port `8080` on your local machine to port `80` in the container, allowing you to access the web server easily.

## Customization

You can customize the web page by editing the `index.html` file:

1. Open `index.html` in a text editor and change the content as desired.
2. After making changes, rebuild the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-nginx .
   ```

3. Restart the container to see your changes:
   ```bash
   docker stop my-nginx-container
   docker rm my-nginx-container
   docker run --name my-nginx-container -d -p 8080:80 my-nginx
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Port Conflicts**: If you see an error about port `8080` being in use, check if another service is using that port. You can change the host port:
  ```bash
  docker run --name my-nginx-container -d -p 8081:80 my-nginx
  ```

- **Repository Not Found**: If you encounter "Repository not found" when pushing to GitHub, ensure that the remote URL is correct and that you have access rights.
